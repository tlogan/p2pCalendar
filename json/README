This is a very basic JSON-parsing library for Standard ML.

The main use case is to instantiate the JSONParser functor with a structure
of callbacks that will be invoked by the parser itself, permitting you to
build whatever internal representation of the JSON you wish.

Running 'make' at the top level will build a test program - json-test.
Running 'make tests' will attempt to run a few tests from the tests directory.

To use this in your own programs, you really only need the sml-json.sml file.

Comments, suggestions or improvements are welcome.
